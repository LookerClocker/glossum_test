If you wont to see the result, just run localhost and open index.html.

You need to run local web server (localhost) because of request!!!

Request to json file would not work if you just open index.html without localhost.
Try to open it in any IDE and run localhost to see the result.

I have done it using pure JavaScript and CSS3
